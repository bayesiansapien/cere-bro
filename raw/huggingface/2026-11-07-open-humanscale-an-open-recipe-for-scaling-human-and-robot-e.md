# Open-HumanScale: An Open Recipe for Scaling Human and Robot Experience for Embodied Foundation Models

Egocentric human video offers a scalable source of manipulation priors for robot learning, yet translating raw data scale into generalizable robot policies demands rigorous data curation and training recipes. We introduce Open-HumanScale, the first fully open recipe for scaling egocentric pretraining to 50,000 hours, anchored by Open-HumanScale-50K---a curated egocentric video corpus densely annotated with hand motion and natural language. Leveraging this corpus, we systematically investigate pure human pretraining via closed-loop simulation evaluations and uncover an empirical log-linear scaling law linking pretraining data hours to downstream robot success rates. Grounded in these findings, we develop HumanWAM-Vanilla, a world--action model pretrained exclusively on 50k hours of egocentric human video. Upon robot post-training, HumanWAM-Vanilla reaches 92.08% success on RoboTwin 2.0 Clean2Clean and 68.88% on Clean2Random, alongside a 14.17% mean success rate and a 19.00 mean progress score on RoboDojo. To push the capability frontier further, we explore joint human--robot pretraining with HumanWAM-Goal, a visual-goal-conditioned world--action model. Hybrid data scaling unlocks broad zero-shot generalization across both simulation and physical benchmarks, propelling post-trained RoboTwin 2.0 performance to new state-of-the-art levels: 92.70% on Clean2Clean and a substantial leap to 84.60% on Clean2Random. On physical robots, HumanWAM-Goal further exhibits emergent embodied in-context learning, dynamically adapting its manipulation behavior to unseen visual goals without parameter updates. To support reproducible scaling research in embodied AI, we open-source the Open-HumanScale-50K corpus, data curation and pretraining pipelines, alongside the pretrained and post-trained HumanWAM checkpoints, inference code, and simulation evaluation suites.
