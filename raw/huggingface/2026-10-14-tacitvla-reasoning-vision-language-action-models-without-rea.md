# TacitVLA: Reasoning Vision-Language-Action Models Without Reasoning Latency

Textual reasoning before acting has improved vision-language-action (VLA) models, but at the cost of latency: every action conditioned on the reasoning text must wait for autoregressive decoding. We show that actions do not need to wait for or condition on the generated reasoning to benefit from it, because the reasoning supervision already improves the backbone representation. We introduce TacitVLA, a reasoning VLA whose action expert never attends to the reasoning it generates for the current call. On long-horizon tasks where the reasoning text also serves as episodic memory, it can generate each entry during action execution rather than before acting. We evaluate it in a controlled study on four benchmarks spanning manipulation and autonomous driving, memory and non-memory tasks: RoboMME, RMBench, LIBERO, and PhysicalAI-AV. On all four, TacitVLA matches the performance of its explicit-reasoning counterpart at up to 3.4x lower latency, and matches the latency of the same architecture trained without reasoning at up to +17.1% success. In absolute terms, it surpasses the best previously published results on the RoboMME Counting suite (82.7% vs. 66.8%) and RMBench (77.5% vs. 56.5%), and reaches 72.9% on LIBERO-Plus and a 52.5% scene score on the public split of the PhysicalAI-AV closed-loop driving challenge.
