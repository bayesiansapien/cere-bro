# DreamX-World 1.0: A General-Purpose Interactive World Model

DreamX-World 1.0 is a general-purpose interactive text/image-to-video world model for controllable long-horizon generation. It supports camera navigation, revisits to previously observed regions, and promptable events across photorealistic, game-style, and stylized domains. Our data engine combines camera-accurate Unreal Engine rendering, action-rich gameplay recordings, and real-world videos with recovered camera geometry. For camera control, we introduce E-PRoPE, a lightweight variant of projective positional encoding that retains PRoPE's projective camera geometry while applying camera-aware attention to spatially reduced tokens. We convert a bidirectional video generator into a few-step autoregressive world model using causal forcing, DMD-style distillation, and long-rollout training. Training on self-generated long-horizon contexts exposes the model to its own generated history and reduces the style and color drift that accumulates across autoregressive chunks. Memory-Conditioned Scene Persistence retrieves earlier views through camera-geometry-based retrieval, while residual recycling makes the conditioning path less sensitive to imperfect memory latents. Event Instruction Tuning adds composable event control, and reinforcement learning alignment recovers camera control and visual quality after distillation. With mixed-precision DiT execution, residual reuse, 75%-pruned VAE decoding, and asynchronous pipeline parallelism, DreamX-World 1.0 reaches up to 16 FPS on eight RTX 5090 GPUs. On our 5-second basic evaluation, DreamX-World 1.0 achieves a camera-control score of 73.75 and an overall score of 84.76, outperforming HY-WorldPlay 1.5 and LingBot-World in overall score, which achieve 80.79 and 80.45, respectively.
