# RoMeRL: Balancing Feedback Coverage and the Memory-Reward Trap in Self-Evolving Agent Memory via Reduced-Order Utility States

Learning-based memory systems for self-evolving LLM agents face two tightly coupled challenges. First, trajectory-indexed utilities grow with the interaction history, thereby dispersing limited feedback over an ever-expanding state space. Second, because trajectory-level rewards are jointly assigned to co-retrieved memories, irrelevant experiences may receive misleading utility updates and consequently enter the memory-reward trap. To address these challenges, we introduce Reduced-Order Memory Reinforcement Learning (RoMeRL), which represents the growing trajectory-indexed utility space using a fixed-dimensional per-task memory state factorized by outcome polarity and memory dynamics. RoMeRL incorporates new experiences through a fixed set of semantic coordinates whose contents are updated or replaced over time, thereby concentrating feedback over a bounded utility support. Theoretically, we show that this reduced-order parameterization increases the average feedback received by each utility coordinate and characterize the steady-state occupancy of erroneous coordinates under a generic coordinate-transition model. Empirically, across ALFWorld and LifelongAgentBench, RoMeRL improves task performance, reduces the Cold-Q ratio by 80.0%, increases feedback density by approximately 6.0 times, reduces the maintained memory size by 84.4%, and cuts LLM calls by 21.1%. These results show that reduced-order utility states support efficient self-evolving agent memory while limiting persistent reward contamination.
