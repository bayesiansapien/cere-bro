# StreamEval: Evaluating Interactive Streaming Video Generation Models

As streaming video generation advances, enabling real-time interaction with generated video is becoming increasingly important. We introduce StreamEval, a unified benchmark for interactive streaming video generation spanning five tasks: avatar dialogue, avatar performance, world generation, instruction editing, and reference editing. StreamEval comprises 300 scripted test cases lasting 15-300s, each specifying initial assets, incrementally arriving multimodal requests, and explicit requirements for state changes and content preservation. Performance is assessed along four evaluation dimensions: task execution, state consistency, visual fidelity, and audiovisual coordination, instantiated through ten task-specific metrics on a 0-100 scale. Evaluating 37 distinct models across 300 test cases, we find that high visual quality and identity retention do not necessarily coincide with reliable request execution or sustained state consistency. In particular, request execution remains challenging: the highest task-specific scores are 36.90 for Following among seven avatar-performance models, 25.93 for Following in text-conditioned world generation, and 15.00 for Edit Success among three reported reference-editing models. These findings identify reliable request execution under timing and preservation constraints as a central challenge for advancing omni-modal real-time interactive systems.
