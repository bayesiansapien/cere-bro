# FineSplat: Fine Patches, Local Groups, Detailed Splats

Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) promises instant scene reconstruction with high-quality novel-view synthesis. Yet, fine-grained geometry and appearance remain difficult to recover, motivating us to revisit how feed-forward models represent, aggregate, and refine detailed visual information. We introduce FineSplat, a feed-forward 3DGS framework built around fine-grained image patches. Since global multi-view attention becomes prohibitively expensive at such high token resolutions, we develop a dual-grouping strategy that combines two complementary forms of locality: view-wise grouping enables efficient interaction among neighboring views, while 3D spatial grouping reconnects geometrically related tokens that may never have interacted under view-wise grouping by lifting them into the 3D scene space. We further leverage reconstruction error as direct feedback, providing an explicit rendering-based signal to recover fine-grained structures and appearance, thereby overcoming the limitations of one-pass feed-forward prediction. Finally, a compact Gaussian generation scheme preserves the benefits of fine-grained features without unnecessarily increasing the number of primitives. Together, these designs enable FineSplat to recover richer geometry and appearance while remaining efficient and compact, achieving state-of-the-art results by a substantial margin, under the same or smaller Gaussian budgets than existing methods.
